# Todooly

This is a simple todo list in ReactJS. I originally made a todo list in vanilla Javascript, but I wanted to practice ReactJs.

I am using Primitive CSS from Tania Rascia in order to reset the document styles and provide basic design for elements. I also used some custom CSS classes to style list components.

I will be continuously working on this project and updating it so stay tuned!
